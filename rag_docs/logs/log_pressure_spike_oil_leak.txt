Incident Date: 2024-01-15
Machine ID: M006

Symptom:
- Sudden pressure spikes in the hydraulic system
- Oil leakage near valve junctions
- Slight drop in overall performance

Diagnosis:
Oil seal degradation led to pressure imbalances within the system. Contaminants in the oil possibly caused erosion near key seals and valves.

Actions Taken:
1. Oil system flushed and replaced with high-viscosity grade
2. Damaged seals and gaskets replaced
3. Leak detection protocol updated
4. Weekly oil sampling implemented

Resolution Time: 2.5 hours
